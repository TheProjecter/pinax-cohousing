This project is being developed initially for [Champlain Valley Cohousing](http://www.champlainvalleycohousing.org/index.shtml) in Vermont.

They use a form of organization called Sociocracy, which is based on consent-based decision making among equal individuals. You can read more about sociocracy at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociocracy

(Actually, any group practicing Sociocracy could use this software. Many features are not specific to cohousing.)

The project will provide member services for this cohousing group, which will include a community calendar, meeting announcements, agendas, minutes, and keeping track of members' work commitments and fulfillment.

This first working phase of the software focuses on the community calendar, meetings and events.

The software is currently based on [Pinax](http://pinaxproject.com/) version SVN-1196. It may not work with other versions of Pinax.

The plan is to bring it up to Pinax 1.0 when that is released.
